"PodDash: Escape from Alienation" was created in the Winter of 2022 in collaboration with one other classmate in our Augmented and Virtual Reality Master's Course. 

My responsibilities focused primarily on establishing the game logic using C# scripts in Unity. We utilized many premade models for the visuals of the game, which we purchased from the Asset Store.

This repository does not reflect a functioning copy of the code base, but rather is meant to emphasize my contribution to the project. Main source script files can be found in the Assets/Scripts folder.

PodDash was originally created to run on the Meta Quest 2 Headset
